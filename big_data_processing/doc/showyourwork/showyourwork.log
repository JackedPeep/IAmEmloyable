"e","# Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements Specification *(10%)*

*   Rewrite the instructions in your *own words*
    *   What does the solution *need to have* or *surround* conceptually?
    *   What does a good solution *look like*?
*   List the things that you *already* know how to do
*   Write down any *challenges* you anticipate




## Phase 1: System Analysis *(10%)*

*   Considering the overall program:
    *   List all kinds of *input* taken in by the program
    *   Describe what form its *output* will take
*   Write brief descriptions of *some* key functions your program may need
    *   Write the function's *name* its *inputs*, and *outputs*
    *   Explain what each function will do in *one sentence*
*   Use English; **NO CODE YET**



## Phase 2: Design *(30%)*

*   **DO NOT COPY AND PASTE YOUR PYTHON CODE HERE!!!**
*   Write *pseudocode* that captures how each function works
    *   **Pseudocode != source code**
    *   If we find too much finished code here, *you will receive a zero*!
    *   It should look like *basic English* with extra indentation
*   Explain what happens to your functions in the face of *good and bad input*
    *   Make a note about *bad inputs* down in **Phase 4**; these will become your *test cases*



## Phase 3: Implementation *(15%)*

*   **DO NOT COPY AND PASTE YOUR PYTHON CODE HERE!!!**
*   Write *code* in the `src/` directory
    *   Copy the outlines from Phase 2 into your `.py` files, and *translate* from English into Python
*   As you translate, you will *encounter problems* that were not foreseen earlier
    *   E.g. things that you learned, things that didn't go according to plan, etc.
    *   Here you can write a brief description of *what* changed and *why*
*   If everything went swimmingly, say so here



## Phase 4: Testing & Debugging *(30%)*

*   For the bad inputs you thought of back in **Phase 2**, write a *test case* that you can run to prove that your functions work as expected
    *   It is not necessarily bad if a function crashes if you can explain *why* and *how* it happens
*   Write the test cases you have *personally run*
    *   The *exact command* you used
    *   Copy & paste the program's *output*
    *   Be precise so that your grader can replicate your experience
*   For any bugs discovered, describe their *cause* and *remedy*



## Phase 5: Deployment *(5%)*

*   *Important:* complete **Phase 6** first!
    *   (I know it's backwards, just go with it)
*   **YOU DON'T NEED TO WRITE ANYTHING IN THIS PHASE**
    *   Just follow this checklist
*   **Push** your final commit to GitLab
*   **Verify** that your final commit was received by *browsing* to its project page on GitLab
    *   Ensure the project's *URL is correct*
    *   Review that all required files are present *in the correct location*
    *   Check that unwanted files *have not* been committed
    *   Add *final touches* to your documentation, including the Sprint Signature and this Plan
*   **Validate** that your submission is complete and correct by *cloning* it to a new location on your computer and re-running it
	*	Run your program from the *command line* so you can see how it will behave when your grader runs it
        *   **Testing in PyCharm is not good enough!**
    *   Re-run your *test cases* to avoid nasty surprises



## Phase 6: Maintenance

*   Write *brief and honest* answers to these questions: *(Note: do this before you complete **Phase 5: Deployment**)*
    *   What parts of your program are *sloppily written* and *hard to understand*?
        *   Are there parts of your program which you *aren't quite sure* how/why they work?
        *   If a bug is reported in a few months, *how long would it take you to find the cause*?
    *   Will your documentation make sense to...
        *   ...anybody *besides yourself*?
        *   ...*yourself* in six month's time?
    *   How easy will it be to *add a new feature* to this program in a year?
    *   Will your program *continue to work* after upgrading...
        *   ...your computer's *hardware*?
        *   ...the *operating system*?
        *   ...to the *next version* of Python?
*   Fill out the *Assignment Reflection* survey on Canvas

I will then create a more effective program that can handle the whole file.
#### Challenges
GreI w Phase 1: Systm:
    *   List all kinds of *input* taken in by the program
    *   Describe what form its *output* will take
*   Write brief descriptions of *some* key functions your program may need
    *   Write the function's *name* its *inputs*, and *outputs*
    *   Explain what each function will do in *one sentence*
*   Use English; **NO CODE YET*er###### Function Name: IndustryDataSet(Input: FIPS files )

    *   Write the function's *name* its *inputs*, and *outputs*
    *   Explain what each function will do in *one sentence*
*   Use English; in a correctly formatted list.
* This returns data organized by *IndustryDataSet()* and returns it as a formatted reports ) 
* Output: Number of FIPS areas, Total/M

4**; these will become your *test cases **DO NOT COPY AND PASTE YOUR PYTHON CODE HERE!!!**
*   Write *code* in the `src/` directory
    *   Copy the outlines from Phase 2 into your `.py` files, and *translate* from English into Python
*   As you translate, you will *encounter problems* that were not foreseen earlier
    *   E.g. things that you learned, things that didn't go according to plan, etc.
    *   Here you can write a brief description of *what* changed and *why*
*   If everything went swimmingly, say so here



## Phase 4: Testing & Debugging *(30%)*

*   For the bad inputs you thought of back in **Phase 2**, write a *test case* that you can run to prove that your functions work as expected
    *   It is not necessarily bad if a function crashes if you can explain *why* and *how* it happens
*   Write the test cases you have *personally run*
    *   The *exact command* you used
    *   Copy & paste the program's *output*
    *   Be precise so that your grader can replicate your experience
*   For any bugs discovered, describe their *cause* and *remedy*



## Phase 5: Deployment *(5%)*

*   *Important:* complete **Phase 6** first!
    *   (I know it's backwards, just go with it)
*   **YOU DON'T NEED TO WRITE ANYTHING IN THIS PHASE**
    *   Just follow this checklist
*   **Push** your final commit to GitLab
*   **Verify** that your final commit was received by *browsing* to its project page on GitLab
    *   Ensure the project's *URL is correct*
    *   Review that all required files are present *in the correct location*
    *   Check that unwanted files *have not* been committed
    *   Add *final touches* to your documentation, including the Sprint Signature and this Plan
*   **Validate** that your submission is complete and correct by *cloning* it to a new location on your computer and re-running it
	*	Run your program from the *command line* so you can see how it will behave when your grader runs it
        *   **Testing in PyCharm is not good enough!**
    *   Re-run your *test cases* to avoid nasty surprises



## Phase 6: Maintenance

*   Write *brief and honest* answers to these questions: *(Note: do this before you complete **Phase 5: Deployment**)*
    *   What parts of your program are *sloppily written* and *hard to understand*?
        *   Are there parts of your program which you *aren't quite sure* how/why they work?
        *   If a bug is reported in a few months, *how long would it take you to find the cause*?
    *   Will your documentation make sense to...

"e","# Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements Specification *(10%)*

#### Instructions
I will be summarizing a data set from the bureau of labor's 2021 data set.  
#### The solution
I will use the methods I learned in last lesson to organize the data into sensible pieces.
I will then create a more effective program that can handle the whole file.
#### Known Methods
Grep, sort, cat, tac.
#### Challenges
I will run into the challenge of not knowing what functions to run in order to decrease the workload on the computer.
## Phase 1: System Analysis *(10%)*

*   Considering the overall program:
    *   List all kinds of *input* taken in by the program
    *   Describe what form its *output* will take
*   Write brief descriptions of *some* key functions your program may need
    *   Write the function's *name* its *inputs*, and *outputs*
    *   Explain what each function will do in *one sentence*
*   Use English; **NO CODE YET**
#### Inputs & Outputs
##### Function Name: IndustryDataSet(Input: FIPS files ) 
* Output: Number of FIPS areas, Total/Max; annual wages, establishment wages, employee wages 
* Organises the Data by Total/Max wages in categories of areas, establishment, and employee.
##### Function Name: Report(Input: IndustryDataSet())
* Output: Number of FIPS areas, Total/Max; annual wages, establishment wages, employee wages  in a correctly formatted list.
* This returns data organized by *IndustryDataSet()* and returns it as a formatted report.

## Phase 2: Design *(30%)*

*   **DO NOT COPY AND PASTE YOUR PYTHON CODE HERE!!!**
*   Write *pseudocode* that captures how each function works
    *   **Pseudocode != source code**
    *   If we find too much finished code here, *you will receive a zero*!
    *   It should look like *basic English* with extra indentation
*   Explain what happens to your functions in the face of *good and bad input*
    *   Make a note about *bad inputs* down in **Phase 4**; these will become your *test cases*
### Pseudo Code
#### IndustryDataSet()
    

## Phase 3: Implementation *(15%)*

*   **DO NOT COPY AND PASTE YOUR PYTHON CODE HERE!!!**
*   Write *code* in the `src/` directory
    *   Copy the outlines from Phase 2 into your `.py` files, and *translate* from English into Python
*   As you translate, you will *encounter problems* that were not foreseen earlier
    *   E.g. things that you learned, things that didn't go according to plan, etc.
    *   Here you can write a brief description of *what* changed and *why*
*   If everything went swimmingly, say so here

## Phase 0: Requirements Specification *(10%)*

#### Instructions
I will be summarizing a data set from the bureau of labor's 2021 data set.  
#### The solution
I will use the methods I learned in last lesson to organize the data into sensible pieces.
I will then create a more effective program that can handle the whole file.
#### Known Methods
Grep, sort, cat, tac.
#### Challenges
I will run into the challenge of not knowing what functions to run in order to decrease the workload on the computer.
## Phase 1: System Analysis *(10%)*

*   Considering the overall program:
    *   List all kinds of *input* taken in by the program
    *   Describe what form its *output* will take
*   Write brief descriptions of *some* key functions your program may need
    *   Write the function's *name* its *inputs*, and *outputs*
    *   Explain what each function will do in *one sentence*
*   Use English; **NO CODE YET**
#### Inputs & Outputs
##### Function Name: IndustryDataSet(Input: FIPS files ) 
* Output: Number of FIPS areas, Total/Max; annual wages, establishment wages, employee wages 
* Organises the Data by Total/Max wages in categories of areas, establishment, and employee.
##### Function Name: Report(Input: IndustryDataSet())
* Output: Number of FIPS areas, Total/Max; annual wages, establishment wages, employee wages  in a correctly formatted list.
* This returns data organized by *IndustryDataSet()* and returns it as a formatted report.

## Phase 2: Design *(30%)*

*   **DO NOT COPY AND PASTE YOUR PYTHON CODE HERE!!!**
*   Write *pseudocode* that captures how each function works
    *   **Pseudocode != source code**
    *   If we find too much finished code here, *you will receive a zero*!
    *   It should look like *basic English* with extra indentation
*   Explain what happens to your functions in the face of *good and bad input*
    *   Make a note about *bad inputs* down in **Phase 4**; these will become your *test cases*
### Pseudo Code
#### 
    if to few argumets:
        print error

         Phase 3: Implementation *(15%)*

*   *OT COPY AND PASTE YOUR PYTHON CODE HERE!!!**
*   Write *code* in the `src/` directory
    *   Copy the outlines from Phase 2 into your `.py` files, and *translate* from English into Python
*   As you translate, you will *encounter problems* that were not foreseen earlier
    *   E.g. things that you learned, things that didn't go according to plan, etc.
    *   Here you can write a brief description of *what* changed and *why*
*   If everything went swimmingly, say so here



## Phase 4: Testing & Debugging *(30%)*

*   For the bad inputs you thought of back in **Phase 2**, write a *test case* that you can run to prove that your functions work as expected
    *   It is not necessarily bad if a function crashes if you can explain *why* and *how* it happens
*   Write the test cases you have *personally run*
    *   The *exact command* you used
    *   Copy & paste the program's *output*

"e","# Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements Specification *(10%)*

#### Instructions
I will be summarizing a data set from the bureau of labor's 2021 data set.  
#### The solution
I will use the methods I learned in last lesson to organize the data into sensible pieces.
I will then create a more effective program that can handle the whole file.
#### Known Methods
Grep, sort, cat, tac.
#### Challenges
I will run into the challenge of not knowing what functions to run in order to decrease the workload on the computer.
## Phase 1: System Analysis *(10%)*

*   Considering the overall program:
    *   List all kinds of *input* taken in by the program
    *   Describe what form its *output* will take
*   Write brief descriptions of *some* key functions your program may need
    *   Write the function's *name* its *inputs*, and *outputs*
    *   Explain what each function will do in *one sentence*
*   Use English; **NO CODE YET**
#### Inputs & Outputs
##### Function Name: IndustryDataSet(Input: FIPS files ) 
* Output: Number of FIPS areas, Total/Max; annual wages, establishment wages, employee wages 
* Organises the Data by Total/Max wages in categories of areas, establishment, and employee.
##### Function Name: Report(Input: IndustryDataSet())
* Output: Number of FIPS areas, Total/Max; annual wages, establishment wages, employee wages  in a correctly formatted list.
* This returns data organized by *IndustryDataSet()* and returns it as a formatted report.

## Phase 2: Design *(30%)*

*   **DO NOT COPY AND PASTE YOUR PYTHON CODE HERE!!!**
*   Write *pseudocode* that captures how each function works
    *   **Pseudocode != source code**
    *   If we find too much finished code here, *you will receive a zero*!
    *   It should look like *basic English* with extra indentation
*   Explain what happens to your functions in the face of *good and bad input*
    *   Make a note about *bad inputs* down in **Phase 4**; these will become your *test cases*
### Pseudo Code

## Phase 0: Requirements Specification *(10%)*

#### Instructions
I will be summarizing a data set from the bureau of labor's 2021 data set.  
#### The solution
I will use the methods I learned in last lesson to organize the data into sensible pieces.
I will then create a more effective program that can handle the whole file.
#### Known Methods
Grep, sort, cat, tac.
#### Challenges
I will run into the challenge of not knowing what functions to run in order to decrease the workload on the computer.
## Phase 1: System Analysis *(10%)*

*   Considering the overall program:
    *   List all kinds of *input* taken in by the program
    *   Describe what form its *output* will take
*   Write brief descriptions of *some* key functions your program may need
    *   Write the function's *name* its *inputs*, and *outputs*
    *   Explain what each function will do in *one sentence*
*   Use English; **NO CODE YET**
#### Inputs & Outputs
##### Function Name: IndustryDataSet(Input: FIPS files ) 
* Output: Number of FIPS areas, Total/Max; annual wages, establishment wages, employee wages 
* Organises the Data by Total/Max wages in categories of areas, establishment, and employee.
##### Function Name: Report(Input: IndustryDataSet())
* Output: Number of FIPS areas, Total/Max; annual wages, establishment wages, employee wages  in a correctly formatted list.
* This returns data organized by *IndustryDataSet()* and returns it as a formatted report.

## Phase 2: Design *(30%)*

*   **DO NOT COPY AND PASTE YOUR PYTHON CODE HERE!!!**
*   Write *pseudocode* that captures how each function works
    *   **Pseudocode != source code**
    *   If we find too much finished code here, *you will receive a zero*!
    *   It should look like *basic English* with extra indentation
*   Explain what happens to your functions in the face of *good and bad input*
    *   Make a note about *bad inputs* down in **Phase 4**; these will become your *test cases*
### Pseudo Code

###Things that went wrong!
1) I couldn't figure out why my dictionary wasn't assigning the proper code.
2) I didn't inderstand why my software iteration wasn't recording any values. 
###Things I fixed!
1) I found out that the reason my dictionary read out was throwing errors was because there was nothing assighned to an `""""` value and so I included {"""", 
0}
2) found that it was reading the `""""`s surounding the string as strings so I included `\""\""` in my checks

## Phase 0: Requirements Specification *(10%)*

#### Instructions
I will be summarizing a data set from the bureau of labor's 2021 data set.  
#### The solution
I will use the methods I learned in last lesson to organize the data into sensible pieces.
I will then create a more effective program that can handle the whole file.
#### Known Methods
Grep, sort, cat, tac.
#### Challenges
I will run into the challenge of not knowing what functions to run in order to decrease the workload on the computer.
## Phase 1: System Analysis *(10%)*

*   Considering the overall program:
    *   List all kinds of *input* taken in by the program
    *   Describe what form its *output* will take
*   Write brief descriptions of *some* key functions your program may need
    *   Write the function's *name* its *inputs*, and *outputs*
    *   Explain what each function will do in *one sentence*
*   Use English; **NO CODE YET**
#### Inputs & Outputs
##### Function Name: IndustryDataSet(Input: FIPS files ) 
* Output: Number of FIPS areas, Total/Max; annual wages, establishment wages, employee wages 
* Organises the Data by Total/Max wages in categories of areas, establishment, and employee.
##### Function Name: Report(Input: IndustryDataSet())
* Output: Number of FIPS areas, Total/Max; annual wages, establishment wages, employee wages  in a correctly formatted list.
* This returns data organized by *IndustryDataSet()* and returns it as a formatted report.

## Phase 2: Design *(30%)*

*   **DO NOT COPY AND PASTE YOUR PYTHON CODE HERE!!!**
*   Write *pseudocode* that captures how each function works
    *   **Pseudocode != source code**
    *   If we find too much finished code here, *you will receive a zero*!
    *   It should look like *basic English* with extra indentation
*   Explain what happens to your functions in the face of *good and bad input*
    *   Make a note about *bad inputs* down in **Phase 4**; these will become your *test cases*

## Phase 0: Requirements Specification *(10%)*

#### Instructions
I will be summarizing a data set from the bureau of labor's 2021 data set.  
#### The solution
I will use the methods I learned in last lesson to organize the data into sensible pieces.
I will then create a more effective program that can handle the whole file.
#### Known Methods
Grep, sort, cat, tac.
#### Challenges
I will run into the challenge of not knowing what functions to run in order to decrease the workload on the computer.
## Phase 1: System Analysis *(10%)*

#### Inputs & Outputs
##### Function Name: IndustryDataSet(Input: FIPS files ) 
* Output: Number of FIPS areas, Total/Max; annual wages, establishment wages, employee wages 
* Organises the Data by Total/Max wages in categories of areas, establishment, and employee.
##### Function Name: Report(Input: IndustryDataSet())
* Output: Number of FIPS areas, Total/Max; annual wages, establishment wages, employee wages  in a correctly formatted list.
* This returns data organized by *IndustryDataSet()* and returns it as a formatted report.

## Phase 2: Design *(30%)*

### Pseudo Code

   ` if to few argumets:
        print error
    open area-titles file using file path from user and target file hardcode
    REMOVE HEADER
    for line in file
        erase all spaces
        lineArray = split line at coma
        add to dictionary
    open 2020.annual file using file path from user and target file hardcode
    REMOVE HEADER
    for line in file
        erase all spaces
        lineArray = split line by comas
        if fipsValue[2:] is not ""000"":
            record values:
            number of areas
            total anual wages
            max anual wages
            total establishments
            max establishments
            total employees
            max employees
        if inustry == software:
            record values:

            total establishments
            max establishments
            total employees
            max employees
    Report values `
* DELETE ALL TODO MESSAGES 

    

## Phase 3: Implementation *(15%)*

###Things that went wrong!
1) I couldn't figure out why my dictionary wasn't assigning the proper code.
2) I didn't inderstand why my software iteration wasn't recording any values. 
###Things I fixed!
1) I found out that the reason my dictionary read out was throwing errors was because there was nothing assighned to an `""""` value and so I included {"""",0}
2) I found that it was reading the `""""`s surounding the string as strings so I included `\""\""` in my checks


## Phase 4: Testing & Debugging *(30%)*

*  or the bad inputs you thought of back in **Phase 2**, write a *test case* that you can run to prove that your functions work as expected
    *   It is not necessarily bad if a function crashes if you can explain *why* and *how* it happens
* W  te the test cases you have *personally run*
    *   The *exact command* you used
    *   Copy & paste the program's *output*
    *   Be precise so that your grader can replicate your experience
* For  ny bugs discovered, describe their *cause* and *remedy*
###Test case
 could run a case where thewe take bits and pieces of the files and test them incramentaly and backward.
* I discovered alot of missed string bugs that I quickly fixed.
* When reading the lines for identifying software vs all the numbers ""0"" and ""10"" were had `""""` around them so I had to take that into account. other wise the information I gathered would turn out to be 0.
