**Over all impression on design:**

The feeling of the UML looks clean and gives me a clear picture of what is suposed to be in the program and how each parent class works with eachother.
I think that the lines could have been cleaner and more clear.

**What I learned:**

I learned that the Menue class has a lot more going on with it than I previously thought witht he MenuOption class in there for more flexibility in the menu. I also learned that the User interface stores every class. It makes sence retrospectivly, but in the moment you kinda gloss over those things.

**I also learned:**

*This is in reguards to the software development plan.* That it takes a lot of thought and work before starting a project. It take a lot of big picture work before getting your hands dirty and in the weeds. 

**UML diagram helped by:**
giving me a birdseye view of the code you will be working with. I actually started by just reading the raw code and I understood it, but by looking at this UML I could just look it over and understand the big picture instead of working with my imagination to draw the conections.
